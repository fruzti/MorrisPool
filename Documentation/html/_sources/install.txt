Installing Enthought Canopy
=============================

You may already have `python <https://www.python.org>`_
installed -- you can check by doing::

  $ python 

If that is the case (or not) you should download and install `Enthought Canopy's Python <https://www.enthought.com/downloads/>`_ 2.7 distribution. 

Enthought Canopy's is a multi-platform python distribution, and it has several licensed products. The **free** option is enough for running the code in any machine.

Installing OpenCV 2.4.6 >
=============================

Due performance issues the image processing part of the software the open library **OpenCV** is used. To download the latest version click `here <http://opencv.org>`_.

For most operating systems (OS) the process to link openCV to python is straight forward, but when using Enthought Canopy IDE it becomes a cucumbersome with Linux, specially.

The recommended SO for this application is Windows, but if you can link OpenCV with python in any other SO it will work smoothly. 

**Note:** After downloading OpenCV perform the next steps.

Linking OpenCV and Canopy in Windows
------------------------------

It is just as simple as copy and paste. 

1. Download Python, Numpy, OpenCV from their official sites.
*(If you already use Canopy there is not need to download Numpy)*

2. Extract OpenCV (will be extracted to a folder opencv)

3. Copy ..\opencv\build\python\x86\2.7\cv2.pyd

4. Paste it in C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages

5. Open Python IDLE or terminal, and type::

	>>> import cv2
	
**Note:** If you decided to **NOT** work with Canopy the above steps are keep just with the difference that `PyLab <http://wiki.scipy.org/PyLab>`_ and `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ must be in your system.

Using the Software
=============================
When all the dependencies are installed in your system and OpenCV is working correctly with Canopy you are ready to use the software.
To run the application, after setting up the experiment, you must have the files mentioned in MorrisPoolâ€™s Structure in your working directory.

Starting the application is pretty easy, just press **cntrl + r** with the file **MainFile.py** open.

- Now, you should put the path of your video into the text entry in the current window and press **LoadVideo**.
- Close all the remaining windows to continue
- In the new window select, using the sliders, where to cut the video and press in the button **StartAnalysis**
- When the analysis is finish, a quest will emerge in console, depending of the type of analysis press **Y** or **N** for the transfer experiment.
- After you selected the type of trial, a new window will pop-up and you will have, now, to select where the target position is using the mouse and clicking in the *Four Corners Points*
- To finish the analysis press *ESC* and wait for the results.
- All, the images and the .txt, will be allocated on your user folder at the end of the analysis.

*Note*

If you are using a **Transfer Experiment** you should look on the **DrawOutput** page to see the instruction for creating the image.
